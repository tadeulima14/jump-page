            <p>This was a intro project to replicate an advertising website for
                bubacan landscaping services. It was a linear column style site and 
                I was able to use flex box and its many properties to
                recreate the page.  <a href = "/Artdm174/lab0/index.html">Git link</a></br>
            </p>
            <a href = "/Artdm174/lab1/index.html">Lab 1 - 8/31</a>
            <p>This page was a refresher on using css grid. Grid was something I enjoyed
                using last semester for my projects and i still like to use it whenever its practical
                because of the page organization and modularity it allows for. 
                <a href = "/Artdm174/lab1/index.html">Git link</a></br>
            </p>
            
            <a href = "/Artdm174/lab2/index.html">Lab 2 - 9/7</a>
            <p>This page was a fictionary fundraising site for reforestation. I used flexbox for this 
                and it was a simple page that shows a image of a forest, a hand planting a tree, and
                a short desdcription about the "fundraiser" and their mission. I also inserted fake contact info.
